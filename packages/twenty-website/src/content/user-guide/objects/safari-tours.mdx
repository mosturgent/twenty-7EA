Twenty lets you create custom objects alongside the built‑in **People**, **Company**, and **Opportunities** records. This flexibility allows you to track domain‑specific data.

## Create a Safari Tours Object

1. Go to **Settings** in the left sidebar.
2. Open **Data model** and click **+ New object**.
3. Choose **Custom** and fill in the singular name `Safari Tour` and the plural name `Safari Tours`.
4. Select an icon and add a short description, then click **Save**.

## Add Safari‑specific fields

After saving the object, you can add custom fields to store information for each tour. Example fields include:

- **Itinerary** – a text field detailing the schedule.
- **Vehicle Type** – a Select field to specify jeeps, vans, or other transport.
- **Guide Assignment** – a relation field linking to your People records.
- **Additional Notes** – a text or long text field for other tour details.

The new Safari Tours object will now appear in your workspace so you can log and manage all tour information just like your other records.
