## Overview

Kanban Views make it easy to manage safari bookings by visualizing each step in the process. Create a **Select Field** named `Stage` and add the following options in order:

1. **Inquiry**
2. **Deposit Paid**
3. **Scheduled**
4. **Completed**

### Create the Kanban View

1. Open your **Bookings** object and choose **Add view**.
2. Select **Kanban** and pick the `Stage` field.
3. Each booking record now appears as a card that you can drag between stages.

### Customize Visible Fields

To show or hide fields on the Kanban cards:

1. Click **Options** in the top-right corner.
2. Select **Fields** and toggle the information you want displayed.
3. Rearrange fields by dragging them into the desired order.

This setup keeps your safari booking pipeline clear and adaptable as your team works through inquiries, payments, scheduled trips and completed tours.
